      I loved teaching and never wanted to stop working. My students meant everything
      to me. But the pain became unbearable. I can barely sit, stand, or walk without
      severe pain. The medications help somewhat but make me foggy and tired. I have
      tried everything - injections, physical therapy, medications - but nothing has
      given me enough relief to work. My depression has gotten worse since I had to
      stop teaching. I feel useless and worry constantly about my future.
