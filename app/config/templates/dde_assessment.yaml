      PHYSICAL RESIDUAL FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY ASSESSMENT (SSA-4734-BK)
      Medical Consultant: Robert Johnson, MD
      Date Completed: 04/15/2023

      PRIMARY DIAGNOSES:
      1. Degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine (M51.16)
      2. Obesity (E66.9)
      3. Hypertension (I10)

      Climbing Ramp/Stairs: Occasionally
      Climbing Ladder/Rope/Scaffolds: Never
      Balancing: Occasionally
      Stooping: Occasionally
      Kneeling: Occasionally

      Fumes/Odors/Dusts: Unlimited
      Hazardous Machinery: Avoid all exposure
      Heights: Avoid all exposure

      SECTION III - MEDICAL SOURCE STATEMENT REVIEW:
      Treating physician Dr. Smith (4F) opined sedentary RFC. This opinion is
      only somewhat persuasive as objective MRI findings (3F@45) show only
      moderate disc degeneration without significant nerve root compression.

      NARRATIVE RATIONALE: Claimant has DDD with moderate findings on MRI (3F@45).
      Treatment records show ongoing back pain managed with PT and NSAIDs.
      Despite allegations of severe limitations, objective findings support
      capacity for light work with postural and environmental restrictions.
      Claimant's obesity is accounted for in postural/environmental limits.

      EVIDENCE CITED:
      - 1F: Initial primary care records
      - 3F@45-52: MRI lumbar spine (persuasive - moderate findings)
      - 4F: Treating physician MSS (somewhat persuasive)
      - 5F@12-20: Physical therapy records
      - 7F: Recent office visit notes
