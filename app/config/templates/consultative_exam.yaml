      Gait antalgic, uses cane. Unable to walk on heels or toes.
      Tandem gait impaired. Station steady with cane.

      GRIP STRENGTH: Right 35 kg, Left 32 kg (normal)

      DIAGNOSES:
      1. Lumbar radiculopathy
      2. Degenerative disc disease, lumbar spine
      3. Obesity

      FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT:
      Based on today's examination:
