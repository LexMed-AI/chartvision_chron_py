      MRI LUMBAR SPINE  Date: 12/16/2020
      INDICATION: Back pain, radiculopathy, muscle weakness
      TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence MRI of lumbar spine without contrast
      FINDINGS:
      L3-L4: Mild facet arthropathy. No significant stenosis.
      L4-L5: Small annular tear with mild broad-based disc bulge. Minimal
      bilateral foraminal narrowing.
      L5-S1: Mild disc desiccation. No herniation.
      IMPRESSION: Small annular tear at L4/L5 with mild broad-based disc
      bulge with minimal bilateral foraminal narrowing. No high-grade
      central canal or foraminal narrowing identified.
